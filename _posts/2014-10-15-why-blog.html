<p>Blogs are dead. Right? They are. The guardian said it. New Republic said it. Forbes said it. Engadget said it. Business week said it. Gigaom said it. Think Progress said it. Gawker said it. ....I could go on. Apparently blogs really are dead. So why (re)start a blog? Is there any value in such an archaic medium? In my opinion, there is. There's a lot of value in it. let me explain.</p>
