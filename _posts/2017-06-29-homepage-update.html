<p>After another way too long absence (half a year) I'm finally back to writing on my blog</p>

<figure style="width: 576px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/hello-boys-im-back.gif" style="width: 576px;"  alt="I'm back!"/>
	<figcaption>Like Randy Quaid as Russel Casse in Independence Day, "I'm Back"</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This was harder than expected, as I had to set up the dev environment on a newly formatted machine <em>and</em> there was a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> update. There have also been some changes to some of the API's I use, so... it was more cumbersone than expected. Also, somehow the local test environment didn't update any page until i didn't delete the content of _site ... <br />
Basically, instead of writing, I had to debug.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also added a favicon.</p>
