<p>
	I just finished beginning to write the 'Projects' section of this homepage. It will be a collection of all the stuff I'm working on (at the moment it's still pretty empty, as I still have to create the content for it.)

<p>
	There are two items currently populating the <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/">projects list</a>: Game A Week and 0h Game Jam. Let's start from the latter: the 0h Jam.
</p>
<p>
	For those who don't know, a short explanation: the <a href="http://0hgame.eu/">0h Jam</a> is a global game jam (I'll talk about game jams in general in a later moment) about making a game in 0h. Yes, Zero hours. The trick is, the game jam is taking place during the 1h of daylight saving time switch, so it's starting at 2:00 AM and finishing at 2:00 AM. I started participating in a few game jams before, but it was all half-hearted attempts, without never actually finishing a game.<br />
	This time, I not only participated, I actually made a game. I went a bit overtime, but I created a stupid little game in nearly 0h: <a href="http://ramsesoriginal.info/0hjam/">Falling Balls</a>. (Another game I made is called Extreme Balls. I have a prototype called Balls. I have another one called Bouncing Balls. I'm starting to see a pattern...). I had all kind of problems making the game (thus the overtime), I talk about that on the game's homepage.<br />
	But I have to say participating in a game jam is great fun! Even though I was ill, alone and under stress, it was a great experience! I can't wait to participate in the next game jam (there are a lot coming up), it's really worth the time!<br />
	This might also be the first game I released that isn't buggy as hell. Yaay!

	Then there's the <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/GameAWeek/">Game a Week</a> project. It's a project that means a lot to me, go read the <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/GameAWeek/">page</a> I made for it, as I have a good description of why I do this, and why I'm starting now. If you're short on time, let me sum up:<br />
	After a long internal struggle I decided, with some motivation from the great <a href="http://adrielwallick.com/">Adriel Wallick</a>, to finally create a game every week, with the goal of improving my game-making skill, to create nice ideas, to make the worst games in my career so that I will only get better from here an and generally just to have fun! But really, go check out the <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/GameAWeek/">page</a> for the Game a Week Project.
