<p>My last post was written 11 months ago to the day.</p>

<figure style="width: 810px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

<p>A lot has happened in the last year, among it also the fact that I lost access to this repository for a while, and that my domain expired.
Like the past 334 days, I really plan to write more regularly again. I might post summaries of University topics, for example.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how often I will actually be able to post, or how long it will take to write the next post, but I hope it won't take another 47 weeks and 5 days.</p>

<p>I'm typing this in the Comapool in university, procrastinating as always. I don't really have something to say, I just wanted to let y'all (according to analytics the incredible amount of 5 people read my last post) know that this blog is not dead, and I plan to write more actively.</p>

<p>I'm so lazy I even used the same gif as my last post. The bar for productivity for me is really low, apaprently...</p>

<p>But I really do have some posts lined up already, one I even already nearly finished. It's about one of the reasons I have been so silent: my incapability to be concise. See y'all soon! (I hope)</p>
