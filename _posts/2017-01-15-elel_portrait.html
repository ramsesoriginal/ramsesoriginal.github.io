<p>Remember Elel, the fireball-slinging axe-wielding high elf acolyte? I drew her!</p>

<figure style="width: 810px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/Elel_Portrait.png" style="width: 810px;"  alt="Character Portrait for Elel"/>
	<figcaption>The picture of Elel (<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/Elel_Portrait.png">high resolution available too</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Yesterday I created the character of <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/01/14/elel">Elel</a>, describing her equipment, skills and backstory in details. Again, I din't have tiem to have an in-depth description of her looks, so I decided to just draw her today.</p>

<p>By the way, I was inspired to create this character from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/305307356313445?view=permalink&id=713943658783144">a thread on facebook</a>, where you could find alternative ways to have an axe-wielding pyromancer.</p>

<p>Created with <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> and a Wacom Intuos Pen&amp;Touch Manga (the previous version of <a href="http://amzn.to/2ijiU1X">this one</a>), and many attempts at lighting a fireball correctly.</p>
