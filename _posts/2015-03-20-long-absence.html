<p>Yesterday I remembered my homepage. Not that I forgot it, but it popped up during a discussion and I instantly felt incredibly guilty. I neglected it, and I shouldn't have. After the first few days life happened, and then I forgot to post, or when I remembered to I didn't have time. A lot has happened in the meantime, but then again nothing important.</p>

<p>What do I plan to do now? AMongst other things, post more stuff here. This is a useful outlet, and i should really be using it more. So, here is my SACRED PLEDGE (which I will forget right away so don't hold me accountable to it): <br />
<em>I will post more regularly on this blog!</em></p>
