<p>Hello. Welcome. Please, enter. Take a seat. Tea? Cookies? No, really, I insist. Are you all set? Ok, then let me start: this is my new homepage. Yes, like in the '90s, this is my lot in cyberspace, my spot on the information superhighway, my node in the world wide web, my electronic home, my corner of The Net, my personal WWW... you get the point.</p>

<p>Now that I got the cheesiness out of my system, let me start. If you have known me for a while, you know I had various homepages and blogs over the last few years, some of them successful, some less. Then I lost my domain (because of lazyness), and with it my motivation to have another reincarnation of a homepage for myself. Well, I got some motivation back, and decided to create a site again. Since you're reading this you're either a very early adopter, or you went back to this old post from some day in the future (That's kinda creepy, don't you think? I'm sure you have your reasons...). Either way, I guess very little people will actually read this. So be honored, you're part of a selected few.</p>

<p>You may wonder why I need a homepage. There are multiple reasons, most of all it's just to express myself and have a central hub for all my stuff. I'm not sure what direction I'm gonna go with this site, it's starting off pretty simple, but who knows what the future brings.</p>

<p>Later I'll write a post about the technology behind the site, and why I chose it, so look forward to that. In the meantime, you probably will find a ton of errors on the page. Let me know of them, maybe I'll fix them.</p>

<p>For now that's all, have a nice stay, and enjoy my new site!</p>
