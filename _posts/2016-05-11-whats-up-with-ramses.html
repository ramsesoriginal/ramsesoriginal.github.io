<p>I have been plenty silent - I really suck at keeping this thing updated. Hopefully this will change! But the question remains: what's up with Ramses? <em>Where in the world is Ramses?</em></p>

<p>What's up with this long absence? Posts every half year? Well, first of all, procrastination is king, apparently. Then we add to that a pinch of wanting to write great posts, and not being happy with my drafts, and <em>huzzah</em>, we have a semi-dormant blog. I wrote and then scratched about a dozen posts, including multiple versions of a post about my trip to Iceland, a post about Boundaries of Light, finally uploading the rest of my game a week games, a few tutorials, a write-up of A.MAZE, ... maybe (hopefully) some of these posts will appear in the future.</p>

<p>For now I will give my best to try to keep this place more alive, posting more stuff. Also to keep me in check, Wanting to post about what I do maybe helps me actually finish stuff? I don't know, hopewfully soemthing good comes from it. Anyway, consider this post a (possible) reboot of this blog.</p>
