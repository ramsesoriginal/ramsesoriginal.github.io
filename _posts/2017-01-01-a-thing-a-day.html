<p>Every skill get better when trained, and having a simple clear goal really helps. Because of that, now I have a simple clear goal: do one thing a day.</p>

<p>The concept isn't new, as aren't my attempts at it. I <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ramsesoriginal/6618714779/">started a 365 photography project in 2012</a> (I took pictures for a few months, but sopped posting them <a hre="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ramsesoriginal/7297452164/in/photostream/">after 20 days</a>). A year later, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ramsesoriginal/8340319274/">I tried again</a>, and (at least in my opinion) my photographic skills already improved quite a lot thanks to the practice I had. This time I kept posting <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ramsesoriginal/8442325592/">for 32 days</a>, and kept shooting a bit more.<br />I then started the <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/GameAWeek/">Game A Week</a> project a while later. It was grand, bold, exciting. Sadly, as most of projects, it failed after a while - I kept creating stuff, but not posting it, missing feedback and time really dug at my motivation, and it kind of faded out. I have a bunch of similar experiences, from review blogs to podcasts, from recoridng music to creating videos, drawing, exercise, ... I could go on.</p>

<p>If you check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/GameAWeek/">Game A Week</a> project page, I have a very lengthy description on why and how doing a regular thing can help achieving goals. This description still stands - I would even say, I'm more convinced then ever that having a regular goal helps. If you read my article on <a href="{{ site.url }}/why-ramses-started-this-blog/">why I did start a blog (and why you should too)</a>, you know one of the reasons was to make me write regularly (turned out great, huh? In 2 and a half years I wrote barely 10 posts... ). Since it's the first of the year today (new year new me.. I'm kidding, of course ;-) ), which is as good of an arbitrary date as every other - but it has the nice advantage that it's nice to track what day we're at, how much time has passed, etc., so I decided to start a new project today. Hopefully it will be more successful then the last ones.</p>

<p>So what am I gonna do this time? Well, something. Literally, <em>some thing</em>. Since my interests vary greatly (remember those "Friendship books" one used to give to friends in primary school? When my sister gave me hers, as "hobbies" I filled in "change weakly" - that still mostly holds true), and span lots of topics, and since I have an incredibly hard time staying focused, I decided that this project will be as general as possible. Make a thing, a single thing, at least on thing, but make it and publish it in one day. This can be a blog post, a photograph, a drawing, a 3d model, a tutorial for a dish I cooked, a recording, a code snippet, the completion of a longer project and follow-up summary, a D&amp;D extension or session summary, a game, a piece of furniture (including tutorial), anything. Literally a thing. I might do a few thematically similar things directly grouped together (a few days of posting code snippets,a or a few days of travelblog posts, ...), I might do completely random order of things.. whatever I end up doing, I <em>am going to</em> actually do one thing a day.</p>

<p>By the way, I set up <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/ThingADay/">a page</a> to check out the list of all the things I did - and to be held accountable if I skip a day or something. But I will try to have a post on the blog every day too, so the blog is a good place to check up on my progress too. </p>
