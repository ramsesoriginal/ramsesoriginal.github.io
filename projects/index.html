title: Projects I'm working on
---
<p>
	I'm constantly working on a few projects. On this page you can get a small overview of what I'm currently working on, as well as past projects. For now it's still very empty, as I just created the homepage and still have to create content, so here you have my favorite gif of all time to keep you entertained in the meantime:<br />
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/hover-husky.gif" style="width: 250px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;display: block;" />

<h2>The projects</h2>
<style>
ul {
	list-style: none;
	padding: 0;
}
</style>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/GameAWeek/">Game A Week</a></h3>
		I make a game. Every week. Or at least I try.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="http://ramsesoriginal.info/0hjam/">Falling Balls</a></h3>
		I created a game in 0h. Or at least, I tried. This is my <a href="http://0hgame.eu/">0h Jam</a> submission, and my first Game Jam in general.
	</li>
</ul>
