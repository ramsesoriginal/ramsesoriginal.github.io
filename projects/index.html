<p>
	I'm constantly working on a few projects. On this page you can get a small overview of what I'm currently working on, as well as past projects. For now it's still very empty, as I just created the homepage and still have to create content, so here you have my favorite gif of all time to keep you entertained in the meantime:<br />
