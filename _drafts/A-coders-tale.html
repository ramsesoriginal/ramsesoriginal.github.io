<p>Wake up. Check phone: 21 notifications, spread on four social media and two news outlets. Nothing important, put phone away. Climb out of bed, search for glasses, fumble, find them, wear them. Grab T-Shirt; It's black, and in white bold monospaced letters there's "I changed your password" written across the chest. It will do, I put it on. There's still coffee in the Mokka, I pour it in my "Aperture Science" cup, take a sip. Will do. Stroll to the computer, sit down. The day can begin.</p>

<p>The first thing I do is check my bugtracker; Nobody added anything. Well, who would? A total of seven people downloaded the prototype: I know all seven of them. "Build it and they will come"... my ass. *sigh*. My motivation wasn't the greatest to begin with, but now it dropped to nearly zero. This project needs to come to conclusion soon, I have thousands of other ideas in my head, but actually finishing a project is on top of my priorities: It's half a year since my last paycheck, the money I saved up is slowly fading away, and I'd really need something to bring in some cash. Not that I would really earn a lot, the payment will be on a donation basis, and I expect nobody to want to shill out any money for this. But it's worth trying. I have to finish this. I still lack motivation, discipline will have to do.</p>

<p>I stare at the code in the editor. My impulse would be to implement one of the many ideas I have for new features for this project, but it's already so afflicted by feature creep, I don't want to bloat it even more. Put on headphones, open up Spotify, and put on the right music to motivate myself for the tedious task of completing the parts I'm currently working on... basically I'm gonna hunt bugs the whole day. I need something that pumps me up... I find the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1166641904/playlist/291iCblGzVp3DIa5CurvAP">right playlist</a>, and switch back to my Editor of choice, Sublime Text Editor. Every time I switch to it I feel a fit of guilt for using it without paying, and every time I pledge to pay for it as soon as I earn money with my projects. Focus. I'm getting distracted by trivialities again, I have to focus. Hands on the keyboard, I have to start working</p>

<p>Humming along the melody of "To the sky" while scrolling through the code, I try to remember where I left off, and then I see the function I was working on: It shouldn't work, I see at least two faults in the algorithm's logic, yet it seems to work. Why? I start analyzing the function, my hands flying over the mechanical keyboard. "Click Clack". Debug Message at the beginning of the function. "Click Clack". Check if parameters are set correctly. "Click Clack". Added breakpoints. Compile. Test. Swear. Close Program, back to Editor. Search where function gets called. "Click Clack". Swear. This debug message doesn't help, delete it again. "Click Clack". Add a few breakpoints. Compile. Swear. Back to Editor, fix the typo I made when deleting the debug message. Compile. Swear. Go back to editor, check what else I modified: it can't be the breakpoints, they won't affect... Swear. Compile again, checking compiler settings. Of course I limited debugging to that single file, and now the other files won't compile properly if they contain breakpoints. Change compiler settings. Compile. Test. Swear, louder then the times before. Why the fuck does this work? It shouldn't. Go back to the editor. Comment out the whole content of the function. "Click Clack". I'm only working since a handful of minutes, yet I'm already frustrated beyond what's good for being productive. To let off some steam, I comment each line manually.. inserting the double-slash at the beginning of each line is soothing. The mechanical motion my hand do, the mechanical sound of my mechanical keyboard... it feels real. Line By Line. "Click Clack". "Click Clack". "Click Clack". "Click Clack". I don't even read the lines I'm commenting out. I know them by now. I know every line in this project. I wrote them all. One by one. Carefully, crafted this artificial being out of nothingness. Working with a team was nice, but creating the project alone is way more satisfying. 27.371 lines of code, each with it's purpose, each carefully written. I'm finally done commenting the function. Compile. Test. It still works. I don't swear. I'm beyond the point of swearing now. THIS PILE OF METAL WANTS TO INSULT ME. There's no other possible explanation for why it works.</p>
